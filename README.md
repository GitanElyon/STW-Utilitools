# Description

Utilitools is a simple tool I made to easily modify the files in fortnite allowing the user to place what are commonly known as "dev builds".

Dev builds have a bunch of uses, but I and my friends primarily use them to study the enemy's AI via observing and documenting strange interactions.

# How to use

I'll make this later, for right now I'm just gonna say: If you cant figure out, you don't deserve to use it.

(I'm kidding, If you're having trouble figuring it out, make sure to check out the docs or reach out. Iâ€™ll add more details here soon!)

Im using it for testing, you should also probably be using it for testing. Please Don't break the law.

If you want to compile it yourself, download [bun](https://bun.sh/) and [rust](https://rustup.rs/). Open the source directory, run `bun install` then `bun run tauri build`. (yes it takes a second to compile. Its Rust, what do you expect?)

Bun is a new fast Javascript runtime, its what allows the frontend to be so fast. Rust is a low-level blazingly fast programming language with am emphasis on safety. Fortunatley, it's also extremly versatile, and allows you write fast, safe and efficient code.

# Misc Info

This was supposed to be a quick 1-day project, but motivation is weird so instead it took me maybe a week.

The original reason I made this was because a friend asked me to, and looking back--I wish I made this ealier. It really helped me a gain a much better understanding of the [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework.

Many of my friends who love disassembling Fortnite to peer into the blackbox that is most of the code always found it a pain in the ass to go into the files each time, so I made this tool to make that process easier and robust all packaged light with high performance. 

I recommend anyone learning the framework try a project like this before jumping into something bigger. Tauri is an incredibly powerfull framework and its easy to get overwhelmed when you are just starting out.

Have fun testing!
